	fonts: these are additional details about the font,

	<!--
	See fontdata.json and change the order of the fonts to
	match the family structure. E.g. light → regular → bold.

	You can specify which font is the "main" font (usually
	the "regular" style), by assigning its ID to the main_id
	variable. Note that counting starts at 0!
