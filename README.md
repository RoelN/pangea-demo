## Project setup & development

This project requires Node.js >= 12 and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

To get started, run the following commands from the root of the repo:

- `yarn install`
- `yarn fontdata` - this will generate data files for the font in `src/fonts`
- `yarn start` - this will start the local development server, view at http://localhost:8080.

The site will [automatically](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) be re-built and deployed on Github Pages every time the master branch is updated.

## What this is

Specimen Skeleton is an [Eleventy-based](https://www.11ty.dev/) specimen _boilerplate_. It helps you get a basic site up and running quickly, and offers you a few interactive elements to build your demos from.

## What this isn't

A full-blown specimen generator like [Specimen Tools](https://github.com/graphicore/specimenTools). We did some groundwork, but it's up to you to build the site!

## Checklist / getting started

- Configure the site in `src/_data/site.js`.
- Add/edit font related data in the files in the `src/_data` directory.
- In JavaScript, respond to fail/success of loading the font in the `FontFaceObserver` code.
- In HTML/CSS, use the `.variable-support` element to commuicate when variable fonts aren't supported.
- Start/stop heavy animations by using the `.am-i-in-view` and `.in-view` classes.

## On using assets

In HTML, to use an image from your `img` directory, use the following URL value with the relative path to your image:

`<img src="{% webpackAssetPath '../img/my_logo.svg' %}">`

If you want to inline an SVG image, use:

`{% include '../img/my_logo.svg' %}`

or

`{% webpackAssetContents 'img/my_logo.svg' %}`

In CSS, point to the file using the path relative to your CSS file:

`background-image: url(../img/my_logo.svg);`

In CSS, images below 8 KB will be inlined automatically. To force inlined or external, append `?inline` or `?external` respectively, e.g. `url(../img/my_logo.svg?external);`. Inlining in HTML files

## Components

The boilerplate has some very basic components you can base your specimen site on:

### Interactive Controls

Basic setup to have interactive axis sliders, as well as a dropdown with named instances. All elements with the class `.interactive-controls-text` inside the parent container `.interactive-controls` will respond to changes.

### Character Grid

Simple grid to show all characters in the font. On hover, the character will be shown in a separate `div`.

### Am I in view?

Simple example to stop CPU-melting animations when they're not in the viewport. Elements with the class `.am-i-in-view` will get a class `.in-view` when they're in the viewport, and have that class removed when they leave the viewport. Use this to start/stop heavy animations.

Note: this can be repurposed for lazy loading images, pausing video, etc.
